# CROWDED SKIES

A personal project to learn Reinforcement Learning and improve my software engineering skills

This project comprises a simple projectile dodging game and a Q-Learning Reinforcement model on top of it.
The model was built from scratch and does not use any RL libraries. The game is built on top of pygame, a minimal game library
